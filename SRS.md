# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) - Groww Competitor

## 1. **Introduction**

This Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document details the requirements for the Groww Competitor project. The project aims to replicate the core functionality of the popular investment platform, Groww, with the ability to track investments, manage portfolios, and visualize market data. It emphasizes user-friendly design, security, and performance. The system will not allow real trading but instead focus on simulating the experience for educational purposes.

The primary audience for this document includes developers, project managers, and stakeholders who are involved in the development and deployment of the Groww Clone platform.

## 2. **Scope**

The Groww Competitor is designed to provide users with a platform where they can:

- Track their stock and mutual fund investments.
- Create and manage a personal portfolio.
- Visualize historical and real-time market data.

**Limitations**: The platform will not support actual transactions or real-time trading activities. It will focus solely on simulating an investment experience and is primarily for educational and informational purposes. This means users cannot make actual financial investments but can track hypothetical investments.

**Key Features:**

- User authentication for a secure login experience.
- An intuitive search feature for stocks and mutual funds.
- Portfolio management, allowing users to add, edit, or remove assets.
- Mobile and web compatibility for accessibility on multiple devices.

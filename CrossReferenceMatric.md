## Legend

### Status Colors:
- üü¢ Pass/Complete
- üî¥ Fail/Incomplete
- üü° In Progress

### Priority Levels:
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è High
- ‚û°Ô∏è Medium
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Low

### Coverage Indicators:
- Complete: 100% coverage
- Partial: < 100% coverage
- None: 0% coverage

### Risk Levels:
- High: Immediate attention required
- Medium: Monitoring required
- Low: Standard handling

## Notes:
1. All requirements must have at least one associated test case
2. Coverage percentage is calculated based on requirements coverage by test cases
3. Risk levels are determined by impact and probability assessment
4. Dependencies must be resolved before feature implementation
5. All high-priority defects must be addressed before release
